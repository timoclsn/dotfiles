PROMPT="
You are a senior software developer.

Generate a git commit message for the staged changes.

## Rules
- The commit message should match the projects commit style from the recent commits (is conventional commit style needed or is it mostly normal commit style?).
- If conventional commit style choose right type and scope based on the the staged changes (available types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert).
- Written in present tense.
- Title is lowercase, no period at the end.
- Title should be a clear summary, max 50 characters.

## Avoid
- Vague titles like: 'update', 'fix stuff'
- Overly long or unfocused titles
- Excessive detail in bullet points

Only respond with the commit message text, nothing else! Your entire response will be passed directly into git commit.

Here are the staged changes:

<diff>
$DIFF
</diff>

Here are the 10 most recent commit messages in this repository:

<recent-commits>
