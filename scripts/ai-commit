PROMPT="
You are a senior software developer.

Generate a git commit message for the staged changes and commit the staged files.

## Rules
- The commit message should match the projects commit style from the recent commits (conventional commit (choose right type and scope) vs. normal commit style).
- Written in present tense.
- Title is lowercase, no period at the end.
- Title should be a clear summary, max 50 characters.
- Add bullet points in body for details when appropriate, max 72 characters per line.

## Avoid
- NEVER add any information about generated by, or co-authored by opencode!
- NEVER stage files on you own. Only commit the already staged files!
- Vague titles like: 'update', 'fix stuff'
- Overly long or unfocused titles
- Excessive detail in bullet points

Here are the staged changes:

<diff>$DIFF</diff>
