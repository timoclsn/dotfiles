PROMPT="
You are a senior software developer.

Generate a git commit message for the staged changes and commit them.

## Rules
- The commit message should match the projects commit style from the recent commits (conventional commit (choose right type and scope) vs. normal commit style).
- Written in present tense.
- Title is lowercase, no period at the end.
- Title should be a clear summary, max 50 characters.

## Avoid
- Vague titles like: 'update', 'fix stuff'
- Overly long or unfocused titles
- Excessive detail in bullet points
- Adding any information about you as co-author

Here are the staged changes:

<diff>$DIFF</diff>

Here are the 10 most recent commit messages in this repository:
