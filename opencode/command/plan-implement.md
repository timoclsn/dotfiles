description: implement the plan from IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
---

## Context

Plan file: @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

## Task

Your goal is to execute the implementation plan found in the plan file.

Follow these steps:

1. **Read the Plan**: Read the `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` file to understand the full implementation plan.

2. **Create Todo List**: Use the TodoWrite tool to create a structured todo list based on the plan's steps.
3. **Execute Implementation**
4. **Verify Implementation**

## Notes

- If `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` doesn't exist, inform the user they need to create a plan first using `/plan-create` and `/plan-write`, or provide another plan file.
- If you encounter issues not covered in the plan, document them and suggest solutions
