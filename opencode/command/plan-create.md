## Context

User request:

$ARGUMENTS

## Task

Your goal is to create a detailed implementation plan based on the user's request.

Follow these steps:

1. Analyze the codebase with the explorer subagent to have enough context about the relevant files regarding the users request.
2. Use the surfer subagent to do external reseach if needed for the users request.
3. Create the implementation plan.
4. Present the plan to the user.

Do not make any changes to the code in this step. Don't write down the plan to a file yet - wait until you are instructed to do so.
