## Task: Save Plan to Markdown File

Write the plan you've already created to `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` in the project root directory.

Format the plan as a proper markdown document that a coworker without context can pick up and execute. Include:

- Clear task description
- Step-by-step implementation with checkboxes
- Files to modify/create
- Any relevant context or code examples

Use the write tool to save the plan to the root directory.
